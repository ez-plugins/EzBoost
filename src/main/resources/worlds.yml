# EzBoost Worlds Configuration
# -----------------------------------------
# Controls which worlds allow or deny boost usage.
#
# Options:
#   allow-list: List of world names where boosts are allowed (empty = all worlds allowed)
#   deny-list:  List of world names where boosts are denied (empty = no worlds denied)
#
# If both lists are empty, boosts are allowed in all worlds.
# If a world appears in both lists, deny-list takes priority.
